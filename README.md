# SIT120-Task-5.1P

In this task, you are asked to build a web-form to replicate the Ice Cream
Membership Registration Form shown below. Please use the Bootsratp 5.3.3
components and valid CSS rules to complete this form

It is important that the form is ‘responsive’ to the device it is displayed on (i.e.,
large monitor or small mobile screen) - ensuring the input fields rearrange
correctly as the window size is reduced. An example of the form displayed on a
smaller screen is shown below.

When completing this form, take into account the following requirements:

1. Consider the data being requested for each field and ensure the relevant
controls are used. For example:

* the phone number field should only accept numbers (10 digits)
* the email address should accept addresses with an __@__ 
* use the date input field for the birthday

2. Ensure all required fields are completed before allowing the form to be
submitted. [NOTE: The submission/posting of the form contents is not part
of this task - We are only expecting the structure/layout/input of the form]

3. Remember the form should be responsive and the labels/fields should
arrange properly when the screen is reduced to a smaller size
